Odin Recipes

How it's made:
The project is entirely made with HTML. The project was from the odin-project, here's a link: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes.
It was the first challenge of the "course" so it was not any CSS or JavaScript involved here. 

Lesson learned:
It was a simple challenge, however, it was good to just type everything out and remembering the core of a HTML file. Writing out all the Doctype and such.
It was also a nice challenge to learn more about Git and GitHub and also typing everything out in a terminal to create all the files and folders. Using 
git was hard for me when i first heard about it, however, The Odin Project did an amazing job teaching how everyhing works.
