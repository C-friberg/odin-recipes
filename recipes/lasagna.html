        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1:</li>
            <p>Gather all ingredients</p>
            <li>Step 2:</li>
            <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned</p>
            <li>Step 3:</li>
            <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p>
            <li>Step 4:</li>
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</p>
            <li>Step 5:</li>
            <p>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
            <li>Step 6:</li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F</p>
            <li>Step 7:</li>
            <p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</p>
            <li>Step 8:</li>
            <p>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>
            <li>Step 9:</li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</p>
            <li>Step 10:</li>
            <p>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving</p>
